# alphabetter-mac
Alphabetter, an IPA input app
## Installation

1. Download the latest `Alphabetter.zip` from the **Releases** page.
2. Double‑click the zip to extract `Alphabetter.app`.
3. Drag `Alphabetter.app` into your **Applications** folder.

## First launch (unidentified developer warning)

Because this is a small, non–App Store app, macOS may show an “unidentified developer” warning the first time.

1. In Finder, go to **Applications**.
2. Right‑click `Alphabetter.app` and choose **Open**.
3. In the dialog that appears, click **Open** again.

After this, you can open Alphabetter normally (Dock, Spotlight, Launchpad, etc.).

## Enabling Accessibility access

Alphabetter needs Accessibility access to read keystrokes and type IPA characters.

1. On first launch, macOS will show a dialog asking to grant access.
2. Click **Open System Settings**.
3. Go to **Privacy & Security → Accessibility**.
4. Find **Alphabetter** in the list and turn it **On**.  
   - If it’s not there yet, click **+**, choose `Alphabetter.app` from Applications, and add it, then enable it.

> **Important:** After changing Accessibility permissions, quit and relaunch Alphabetter to make sure it picks up the new access.

## Updating

If/when I release a new version:

1. Quit Alphabetter if it’s running.
2. Download the new `Alphabetter.zip` from Releases.
3. Replace the old `Alphabetter.app` in Applications with the new one.
